## Overview
Scratch2Hookks is a fork of [scratch-blocks](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-blocks) project that provides a design specification and codebase for building creative computing interfaces. We plan to use it to build dedicated programing lanaguge blocks for smart contract development.


## --> VIP Note <--
This project has just started and we are looking forward to develop our own blockcs for learning smart contract programing
